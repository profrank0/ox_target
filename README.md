## ox_target

A performant and flexible standalone "third-eye" targeting resource, with additional functionality when using ox_core, esx, or qb-core.

ox_target is the successor to qtarget, which was a mostly-compatible fork of bt-target.
To improve many design flaws, ox_target has been written from scratch and drops support for bt-target/qtarget standards, though partial compatibility is being implemented where possible.

- Performance increased ~4x compared to qtarget.
- Improved error handling protects against soft-locking.
- Improved entity and world collision detection.
- Options now stack, rather than overriding.
